# watchdog
Pythonscript for monitoring and (re)starting programs.

After compilation intended for execution under Windows.

Python and pyinstaller for Windows are required to create and compile the program.

To compile Python into a single .exe file that contains all dependencies:

`pyinstaller watchdog.spec`

To be honest, I don't know how to program at all and have been helped by AI support.
If you don't have a problem with that, everything is great.
If you do; no problem either.
